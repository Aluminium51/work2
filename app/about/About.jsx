            The Electrical Engineering Department (CUEE) in collaboration with
            the International School of Engineering (ISE) has launched a new
            bachelorâ€™s degree program in semiconductor engineering (SEMI). This
            program focuses on various aspects of semiconductor technology, from
            designing advanced semiconductor devices, circuits, and systems, to
            fabricating, testing, prototyping, employing, and optimizing them
            for 21st-century applications that include edge computing,
            cloud-based applications, electric vehicles (EV), and generative AI.
            We will start accepting applications from Thai applicants during the
            admission round from February 26 to March 26, 2025.
